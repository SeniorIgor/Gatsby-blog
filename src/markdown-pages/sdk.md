### Software development kit (SDK).

A software development kit (SDK) is a collection of software development tools in one installable package. They facilitate the creation of applications by having a compiler, debugger and perhaps a software framework.

Here is a description of software development kit from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development):

> A software development kit (SDK) is a collection of software development tools in one installable package.
> They facilitate the creation of applications by having a compiler, debugger and perhaps a software framework.
> They are normally specific to a hardware platform and operating system combination. To create applications
> with advanced functionalities such as advertisements, push notifications, etc; most application software
> developers use specific software development kits.

> Some SDKs are required for developing a platform-specific app. For example, the development of an Android app
> on the Java platform requires a Java Development Kit. For iOS applications (apps) the iOS SDK is required.
> For Universal Windows Platform the .NET Framework SDK might be used. There are also SDKs that add additional
> features and can be installed in apps to provide analytics, data about application activity, and monetization
> options. Some prominent creators of these types of SDKs include Google, Smaato, InMobi, and Facebook.
